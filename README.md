# The Cognitive Control Game 1.0

![](CoCon.gif)

## Aim

**Cognitive Control is a critical aspect of our adaptive nature** and has been shown to be strongly related to many positive outcomes, such as **wellbeing**, **mental health**, **emotion regulation** and **goals achievement**. However, there is a general agreement that it is not a **unitary process**, but an ability emerging from the integration of several **distinctive** and **independent** mechanisms.

While an accurate assessment of cognitive control is critical in neuropsychological practice and research, it often remains a challenge:

- The tasks used in clinical practice are very different from the ones used in research
- The assessment of different cognitive control components is done through very different tasks, requiring a selection that rarely provides a comprehensive view
- The existing tasks are often not very user-friendly, being often long, boring, not interesting, stressful and tiring


The goal of this project is to build a **single task** that measures several **distinct components** of cognitive control and allows their delineation. Moreover, by bridging advanced statistical processing with a game-like design, we hope to create a task that is **comprehensive**, yet **specific**, **short**, yet **robust**, **precise**, yet **interesting** for the patient. This task should be suited for clinical practice and research and for different age groups, as well as runnable on different hardware setups.

## Project Steps

- [ ] Developing a prototype (in python)
- [ ] Testing the prototype 
- [ ] Developing the game (in Julia - Makie? Unity?)
- [ ] Validating the game


## Contribution and Collaboration

This is currently a side-project with no official existence (and no money). However, if you're interested by this idea (or have any thoughts, suggestions or ideas), please let me know by [opening an issue](https://github.com/neuropsychology/CognitiveControl/issues) or contacting me ([dom.makowski@gmail.com](https://dominiquemakowski.github.io/)).
